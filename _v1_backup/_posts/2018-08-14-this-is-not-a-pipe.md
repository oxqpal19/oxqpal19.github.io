![形象的叛逆](/assets/images/2018-08-14-this-is-not-a-pipe.jpg)

这张图片展示了一个烟斗。在下方，Magritte写下了“Ceci n'est pas une pipe”（法语，意为“这不是一个烟斗。”）这幅图并非一个烟斗，而是烟斗的一幅*图像*，这就是Magritte想表达的。

> 有名的烟斗啊，人们老是用这个来批评我。但是你能填满我的烟斗吗？你不能，因为画上的只是一种象征，难道不是吗？所以如果我写下“这是一个烟斗”这样的话，我就是在说谎了！ —— Magritte

## 注解

“这是一个烟斗”这句话，准确的说，是在说“这是一个烟斗的图象”。精确性和简洁性是互相矛盾的；在语言上是这样，进一步说，基于Zipf的[最小努力原则](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/principle_of_least_effort)，可能在一切思考和行为上也是。例如，无论注释是什么，一幅龙的图象可能会让人觉得它是真实存在的。这是谬论。这可能就是任何象征——图象和文字的魔力——塑造我们的认知的普遍存在的陷阱。也许，隐含之物就是谎言。（Maybe underlying is lying!）

如果the dragon is no more than an image of surrealistic imagination, say, from the scientific perspective? Is it not that lying is underlying such images as on the right? What about the story or history of St. George who allegedly pierced the dragon with the spear? From the commons: Category:Saint George and the Dragon and the like, guess how expandedly such images are reproduced and used for brainwashing. Perhaps the surrealist artist Magritte may well know how easy it is to use images and words in lying or brainwashing. They may be not only uncertain but also unreal and untrue. That is, the artifact is not referring of itself, but related by the cognitive or "knowing subject," to the fact.
The vital question of truism doubted (hence famously dotted) between the artifact and the fact may have been (perhaps first and best) shown by Ogden & Richards (1923), by virtue of the w: triangle of reference on the right bottom, as parodied 6 decades later by an English philosopher Simon Blackburn (1984) without reference to such a definite precursor or predecessor he must know. What made him shy away at all? What an academic shame or infame anyway! Academia may be an ivory tower no more but just a center for hacking and parody at will -- perhaps a sign of ugly ending of capitalism! Perhaps a way of survival may be to "acknowledge intellectual debts" frankly.
